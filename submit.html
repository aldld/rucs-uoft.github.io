    <p>
        The Review of Undergraduate Computer Science (RUCS) only publishes
        extended abstracts (650 – 1050 words).  If you are interested in submitting,
         please read the following and send any questions to
         <a href="mailto:julia@cs.toronto.edu">julia@cs.toronto.edu</a>.
             The deadline for submissions is September 11, 2016.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you are interested in making a submission, please be sure to
        download and fill out the <a href="assets/supervisor-form.docx">Supervisor
        Approval Form.</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        We've prepared a template <a href="assets/rucs-template.tex">latex file</a> and
        a template <a href="assets/bib_template.bib">bib file</a> for your
        submissions. 
    </p>

    <h3>Who can make a submission?</h3>

    <p>
        Anyone who has worked in a research setting is encouraged to submit, even
        if your project focuses more on development
        than research.  If you are unsure about your eligibility, please contact
         <a href="mailto:julia@cs.toronto.edu">julia@cs.toronto.edu</a>.
         with your situation.
    </p>

    <h3>Why should you submit?</h3>

    <p>
        It is an opportunity for your work to get published and would look great
        on your resume! As well, we partnered with Google last year to organize an
        exclusive networking event for students published in RUCS,
        and we hope to organize a similar event this year. One published student
        from last year then went on to join Google in early 2016. We are also
        planning to select the best three submissions from Cornell and pay for their authors to come 
        up to Toronto in October for a weekend of discussing research, sharing ideas, and fun activities
        with the other published students.
    </p>

    <h3>What criteria do submissions need to meet?</h3>

    <p>
        Your submission should be either a LaTeX source file (.tex with
        accompanying references in a .bib file) or a Word document (.docx, .doc)
        containing an extended abstract that is 650 – 1050 words in length
        (excluding the title, section headings, and citations); LaTeX is strongly
         preferred. The extended abstract should summarize the work you have done
         and should be accessible to students unfamiliar with your specific field
         of research.
         Please read the template, the
         <a href="http://rucs.ca/assets/pdf/Extended_Abstract_Exemplar.pdf">
         exemplar</a>,
         the
          <a href="http://rucs.ca/assets/pdf/Best_Practices_Guide.pdf"> best practices guide</a>,
         and the instructions below to gain a better understanding of what
         is expected.
    </p>

    <h3>What is the submission process?</h3>

    <p>
        The RUCS review process is ‘internal’; in place of an external review board,
         it is expected that your supervising professor and graduate mentor
         (if applicable) will review your extended abstract for correctness and
         accuracy. Please follow these steps carefully:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Approach your supervisor and graduate mentor (if applicable)
            and express your interest in submitting to RUCS.  Only proceed if they agree.
        </li>
        <li>
            After reading all of the provided documents, prepare a first draft.
            Ask your graduate mentor or supervisor to help edit the initial drafts.
            Your supervising professor should review, at the very least, the final
            draft of your extended abstract.
        </li>
        <li>
            Email your submission to <a href="mailto:julia@cs.toronto.edu">julia@cs.toronto.edu</a>
            with the subject line “RUCS Extended Abstract Submission”.  Fill
            out the Supervisor Approval form and follow the submission
            instructions on the page. Both should be submitted by September 11, 2016.
        </li>
    </ol>
